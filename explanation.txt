total number of lines - 2+2*n+n*m -> 12Lines
Number of people in first line - 2
Number of pairs to be tested in second line - 3
Preference list from line 3 to 6
with first n lines containing the Preference for women follwing n lines containing Preference for men
Next n*m lines for 3 assingments each given as 3 lines containing woman man pairs

First of all assingment is completely women centered i.e., women will pickup men

Here our task is to design the algorithm, form the stable pairs using our program 
and check the given pairs(test cases) to determine the number of unstable pairs

Output must have 3lines with [1/0, 4, 0], [1/0, 4, 0], [0, 4, 1] where
1st number says if our algorithm output and the test case matches then its 1 else 0,
the second number says square of the no of men/women, third number says the number of
from the test case which doesn't match with the actual algorithm output i.e.,
number of unassigned pairs algorithm checks to determine the instability
