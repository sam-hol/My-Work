Steps to run the gale shapely algorithm or run it in O(n^2) time:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
read the input data from the text file.
assume men from number 1,...,n
assume women from number 1,...,n
create list of free men
create two arrays initialised to 0:
    one array is wife[m] and other is husband[w]
for each man:
    do create man-women preference array
    do create woman-men preference array
create a count[m] array for each man to track the number of proposals made by each man
now create an inverse array for each woman to using her own preference lists
code to create the inverse list is as follows:
    for i = 1 to n:
        inverse[pref[i]] = import

Now we are ready to start the iterations of the gale shapely algorithm:
create a procedure called obtainStablePairs:

now we will first check for the free men from the free men list
pickup the first available free man
check the mans highest preferred woman and check if she is free using the husband[w] array
if everything works engage this as a pair and update the same in the hus[w], wife[m] arrays
else if woman is busy check the proposal that she had received from and get her current partner
now use the inv array to see who she has highest pref to and based on this update the 
 hus, wife, free man arrays
this process continues until all the freemen are engaged
